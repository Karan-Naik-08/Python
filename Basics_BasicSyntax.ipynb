    "# What Is Python\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted popular programming language known for its simplicity and readability.\n",
    "### History Of Python\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum. In February 1991, the first public version of Python, version 0.9.0, was released.\n",
    "The language was named after the British comedy series \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\". It's first useable version was 1.0 that was relased in 1994.\n",
    "### Features Of Python \n",
    "1) Easy to Use - Simple Syntax makes it easy to use and Read.\n",
    "2) Dynamically Typed - We don't need to specify the data types of variables , they're determined automatically.\n",
    "3) Cross Platform - It can be used on any System Windows, Mac, Linux etc.\n",
    "4) Wide Range of Libraries - It comes with very wide range of Libraries that help with Multiple tasks like Testing, Web Development, Machine Learning etc.\n"

    "1. Using Interactive interpreter prompt : To open the interactive mode, open the terminal (or command prompt) and type python (python3 in case if you have Python2 and Python3 both installed on your system). It will open the console with (>>>) sign where we can execute the Python statement and check their impact on the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using a script file : Using the script mode, we can write multiple lines code into a file which can be executed later. For this purpose, we need to open an editor like notepad, create a file named and save it with .py extension, which stands for \"Python\".\n",

    "A comment in programming is a piece of text within the code that is not executed by the computer when the program is run. Comments are meant for human readers to understand the code better. They are used to provide explanations, documentations, or reminders within the code. Comments can describe the purpose of a piece of code, clarify its logic, provide context, or serve as reminders for future changes.\n",
