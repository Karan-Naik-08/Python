# Python Roadmap Practice

## Overview
This repository contains my Python practice exercises, following a roadmap to master Python. I’ve completed the **Basics** section and uploaded separate Jupyter Notebook files for each topic. I’m currently working on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

## Roadmap Sections
1. **Basics** (Completed):
   - Basic Syntax, Variables, Data Types, Conditionals, Loops, Exceptions, Functions, Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries.

2. **Data Structures & Algorithms **:
   - Arrays, Linked Lists, Heaps, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Trees, Recursion, Sorting Algorithms.

3. **Future Topics** (To be covered):
   - **Automation**: File handling, Web scraping, GUI, Network automation.
   - **Data Science**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Machine Learning libraries.
   - **Testing**: Unit testing, Integration testing, End-to-end testing.
   - **OOP**: Classes, Inheritance, Methods.
   - **Advanced Python**: List comprehensions, Lambdas, Decorators, Functional programming, Multithreading.

## Next Steps
I will be working on the **DSA** section and updating the repository with new files as I progress.
